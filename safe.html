            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">
                From the way our system is designed, even our development team cannot identify which token belongs to which server. 
                We prioritize security by not storing your API URL, only your CAD token, which is encrypted alongside your guest token.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">
                To maintain the highest level of security, you will need to renew your tokens every <strong>60 to 90 days</strong>. 
                This ensures your CAD API stays as secure as possible.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">
                Our API website restricts updates to department heads, allowing them to update call signs only. Deleting is not 
                supported at this time, and updates can be performed securely without risk.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">
                If you need to delete a user, you can use the administrative panel provided in your CAD system.
